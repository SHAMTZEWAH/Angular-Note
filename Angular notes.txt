Setup Typescript
1. Install Node.js
2. Open Visual Studio Code in Admin
3. run cmd at terminal: npm --init (to generate package.json)
4. run cmd at terminal: npm i typescript (to generate module)
5. run cmd at terminal: npx tsc --init (to generate tsconfig.json)
6. run cmd at terminal: npx tsc on the ts file (compile a js file as output) OR tsc.cmd

Diff between SPA and MPA

Library: Angular Slash Router
SEO: SSR (server side rendering)

Syntax:
let keyword is use for declaration

Setup Angular
1. run cmd: D: //to the drive d
2. run cmd: cd D:\"Angular Tut" //to the directory u prefer
3. run cmd: npm i @angular/cli -g //to install angular
Ensure the environment variable is:
C:\Users\User\AppData\Roaming\npm\node_modules\@angular\cli
C:\Users\User\AppData\Roaming\npm

4. run cmd: cd D:\"Angular Tut"\"Angular Tut" //to change directory for workspace
5. run cmd: ng new [name] --create-application=false //to create new workspace

6. run cmd at terminal: npm i (by focusing on the package.json)
7. restart ur machine if error occur
8. or else change the version of nodejs

9. Right click on the root folder (project folder) > Open with Integrated terminal 
10. run cmd at terminal: ng g app realinventory
https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/how-to-fix-ps1-can-not-be-loaded-because-running-scripts-is-disabled-on-this-sys/ (if not working)

Alternative from step 5-10:
11. Delete realinventory folder > run cmd: ng new hotelinventoryapp
12. To uninstall angular: npm uninstall -g @angular/cli
npm cache verify

Note: 
-Angular.json is a file that relates to your workspace.
-Polyfills is for the dev to add extra features / codes like animation into certain version of browser.
-In angular.json, sourceRoot is all the files that will be use in app
-styles allow u to add bootstrap 
-Component, Directives and Pipes will be registered in the Declaration
-Decorator modifies the behaviour of our classes
-spec.ts is use for unit test

Note for files:
-app.component.ts template properties will override the output in the app.component.html
-if angular.json -> prefix: hinv; then index.html -> app-root changes to hinv-root; then in app.component.ts, change app-root to hinv-root; ng serve again in cmd
-The purpose of prefix is to avoid conflict with other existed html tag

12. run cmd: ng serve (execute the app)
13. Install Angular Language Service Extension

14. run cmd at terminal: ng g c rooms (to create component of rooms. Rooms is the name of component)

Note of behaviour and property in Angular:
Properties: [innerText], [hidden] 
Action: (click)

Cheat key:
Ctrl + p : open file in browser F12

Note of Directives:
-Directives is an reusable function / feature to change the appearance of the application 
-Directives can implement all lifecycle hook.
-Directive wont be having a template file, but component file can have template file
-Strucutural Directives (change behaviour of app), Attribute Directives
-Built-in Directives: *ngIf, *ngFor, *ngSwitch, ngClass, ngStyle
-rely on *ngIf instead of hidden attribute
-condition??elseResult

Note of Pipe:
-used for data transformation
-Built-in pipes: eg. Long Date to Short Date, currency conversion
-Suggested to use server-side pagination or server side filtering and not pipe slice

Setup Bootstrap:
1. Install bootstrap: https://valor-software.com/ngx-bootstrap/#/ or Google: ngx-bootstrap
2. run cmd at terminal: ng add ngx-bootstrap (to add bootstrap into angular project)
OR (if not working)
@run cmd at terminal: ng add @ng-bootstrap/ng-bootstrap
npm i bootstrap
3. @Go to realinventoryapp\node_modules\bootstrap\dist\css\bootstrap.min.css to copy the relative path
4. @paste at styles.scss: @import '.\bootstrap\dist\css\bootstrap.min.css'
Issue: C:/Users/User/AppData/Roaming/npm/node_modules/@angular/cli/lib/config/schema.json" cannot resolve
Solution: npm install @angular/cli updated

Note for Lifecycle Hook:
1. constructor is used for injecting the services
2.oninit is use to write logic
3. constructor should not have blocking code (what is blocking code? like logic?)
4.eg. ngInit, ngOnChanges, ngDoCheck, ngDestroy
5. Component comm. : interaction between component like room and customer maybe
6. Oninit is to render things, not retrieve / transfer data
7. Concept of immutability is important when using state management technique (ngrx, ngxs). Immutability means that it will always return new instance.
The purpose of immutability is to avoid checking the changes on the original instance that checking the changes from view is expensive. Therefore, return a new instance is better.
8. when new value is obtained, ngOnchanges is involved. For logging purpose.
9. DoCheck = OnChanges in expensive version
10. ngAfterViewInit = load a component using view child (Example: Header)
=when every component is ready and initialized, therefore, it is safe to use them
11. ngAfterViewChecked = A stage where the detected changed-check cycle is completed for a component view
12. Development mode vs Production mode
run change detection twice vs 
ExpressionChangedAfterItHasBeenCheckedError is throw becuz previous value is undefined. NO WORRY! But if in Production Mode, then GG
13. Dynamic component (ng-template): can help to render other template?? (Example: dynamically load the room component)
14. 

Setup Additional Angular Extensions / Features:
1. Check on the (Besides Settings > More Tools > Rendering (near Styles, Computed, Properties there) > Paint Flashing) to observe changes / rendering components
2. Install Angular Dev Tools: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/angular-devtools/ienfalfjdbdpebioblfackkekamfmbnh
3.
